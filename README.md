The following technologies were used to built this app => `react.js` and `redux`. This repo has redux devTools enabled so you can follow the state of the app in your browser by having [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) chrome extension.

I've also integrated _redux-logger_ which does a similar process in the browser console.
This application was built with `create-react-app`.
